# Pricing

**We like to produce and release well-known software products, including their source-code, for free,** but we are unable to offer all free services due to the high cost of maintaining the infrastructures. We are a humble team not funded by any venture capital, and we are working really hard to make our services affordable to everyone by reinvesting all the profits into the open-source community.

In addition, we also offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions for businesses and organisations. Please contact us for more information if you wish to run your own email service using your infrastructure.
