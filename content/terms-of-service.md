Last Update: 22 May 2022

[TOC]

## Introduction

Welcome to [Ophuscado.com](/)(the "site"). The site is owned and operated by Ophuscado Pte. Ltd.(the "company", "we", "us", or "our").

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your use of this site and all current and future products and services (individually and collectively, the "Service") offered by us.

By using the site and the Service offered by us, you agree to be bound by the following Terms.

If you agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you should have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Service through your account. You may not use the Service in the absence of such an authority.

## User

The Service is offered exclusively to individuals at least 13 years old or minors who have received the legal guardian's permission to open and maintain an account.

The Service is provided exclusively to persons. Accounts registered with "bots" or automated methods are not approved and will be terminated.

You are solely responsible for all the messages sent via the Service.

## Use of the Service

- You agree not to use the Service for any illegal or prohibited activity.

- You agree not to disrupt our network and servers.

- For these Terms' purposes, spam refers to the purpose of advertising, phishing, and spreading malware or viruses ("spam"), usually irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent to many users over the Internet.

- You agree to not use the Service to send spam, junk mail, bulk emails or mailing list emails that contain persons who have not explicitly agreed to be included in your mailing list.

- You agree not to use the Service to store or share unlawful content.

- Any account found to be sending, storing or sharing the aforementioned types of emails or contents will be immediately suspended.

- We may terminate accounts used for illegal activities, especially in response to court orders from competent authorities notifying us of such illegal activities.

- You can own multiple free accounts as long as it is reasonable. However, an individual who creates many accounts is not a fair use of the Service. We reserve the right to take action against any free account considered abusive in that regard.

- You acknowledge that we do not have the ability or obligation to recover your data if you misplace your decryption password.

- You also acknowledge that the company also has no obligation to store messages or contents for accounts that exceed their storage quotas.

- We have no obligation to store or forward the contents of terminated accounts.

- We reserve the right to suspend or delete inactive accounts for over one year. Paid accounts with active paid status are not subject to this measure.

- You agree not to infringe the legal protection afforded by copyright, trademarks, license rights and other laws to materials accessible through our Service.

## Payment and Refund

- If a fraudulent payment is identified （such as using a stolen credit card）, we have the right to discontinue Service immediately. And such cases may be referred to the authorities.

- You authorise us to charge your designated payment methods (such as bank account, credit card, PayPal, etc.) monthly, bi-annually, or annually re-occurring (depending on your selection). You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment methods records and sufficient funds in your account.

- If you fail to fulfil your payment obligation for any reason, we may suspend your account immediately and delete it after an extended period.

- If you rely on third-party payment processors' dispute or chargeback processes and the outcome of that system causes us to be liable for a sum above the price of the Service (such as a dispute fee), you are authorised us to charge you that amount on your account.

- Paid accounts terminated due to violation of these Terms will lose all payments and will not be eligible for refunds.

- In all conditions, Cryptocurrency payment is non-refundable. We are unable to identify any crypto wallet ownership.

- Generally, the Service is non-refundable, and any refunds given will be at our sole discretion.

- If we issue a refund for any reason, we only refund it in the original currency and the original payment method.

- We have discretion over the exchange rate applied if you request a credit balance converted between various currencies we support.

## Privacy

We clarified in the [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) how we treat and protect your personal data and privacy related to your use of the Service and browsing of the site. You will agree to these Terms and abide by our Privacy Policy to be allowed to use the Service.

## Limited Warranty and Liability

Despite our best efforts, we can not make any guarantee about the reliability of the Service or the security of your data. The services are provided as-is, and you agree not to hold us responsible or claim indemnification for any damages (which may be due to loss of use, data or profits in connection with the performance of the Services or failure of such performance).

In addition, you will not hold us liable or seek compensation if confidential material is unintentionally disclosed due to a security failure or a vulnerability in the performance of the Services.

You agree that we can make modifications and improvements to the Service at any time. And we can, at its absolute discretion, terminate the Service without cause or notice.
