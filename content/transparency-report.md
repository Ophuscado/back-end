# Transparency report

[TOC]

## Introduction

Ophuscado may receive requests for assistance from law enforcement authorities from time to time. In order to share this information with users, we regularly generate Transparency reports on government requests for user data. The report offers information about the number, the nature and the scope of the requests.

As long as we receive a judicial order from the courts of Singapore or an emergency request from government departments, we have an obligation to provide any available user information to help the authorities identify users subject to criminal investigations.

At the same time, Ophuscado applies strict procedures to handle these requests. We will carefully review the legal adequacy of each data order received. And we may refuse or require more specific requests for excessively general or vague requests. Suppose we doubt the legality of orders determined under Singapore laws. In that case, Ophuscado will always ask the Singapore authorities to make further clarifications. Suppose the suspicion still exists and the order does not seem to meet the legal requirements. In that case, Ophuscado will challenge it to the extent permitted by the law.

Ophuscado may take action on other types of requests. For example, there is overwhelming evidence that an account has been used for illegal activities (that violate Ophuscado [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service#user-obligation). The account will be imminently suspended. The illegal activities include phishing, ransomware, identity theft, etc. (However, unless a qualified legal order is also received, no data will be passed on to any third party during this process.)

Besides the clauses listed in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), Ophuscado may be obligated to monitor an IP address engaged in criminal activities in extreme criminal cases.
