# Donate

**Support Ophuscado. Help us fulfil our mission.**

Our mission is to protect online privacy and security. That's why we developed Ophuscado.

Your donation can help us continue to develop Ophuscado as open-source software and offer more Free-accounts. Only through the community's support can we continue to provide Ophuscado services to people worldwide.

## Donate to Ophuscado Free-Account Program

Ophuscado release [Free-accounts](help-centre/billing/ophuscado-memberships#discount-and-free-account) on our social media from time to time.

We use our revenue to finance the free accounts with the hope that more people can enjoy encrypted mail (even people who can't afford a Ophuscado paid account currently).

However, our resources are limited. With your help, privacy and online security will reach more people.
That's why we initiate this Free-account donation program.
If you support privacy and online security for the whole of humanity, please help us.

The first goal is to unlock 10000 Ophuscado Nubo accounts.
The yearly membership fee is $18. The amount of the goal is:

**$180000**

We will release 100 accounts for every $1800 we receive. And we will distribute the free-account coupon on social media immediately.
